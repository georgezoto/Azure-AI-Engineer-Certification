Enter the prompt (or type 'quit' to exit): draw a plane
As a text-based AI, I can't draw images directly, but I can create a simple ASCII art representation of a plane for you! Here it is:

```
       __|__
--o--o--(_)--o--o--
```

If you need something different or have another request, just let me know!
Enter the prompt (or type 'quit' to exit): Draw an animated plane
I can’t create animated visuals directly, but I can represent the basic concept of an animated plane using a sequence of text art that you can imagine moving:

```
       __|__
--o--o--(_)--o--o--

       __|__
        \ 
         \ 
          \ 
--o--o--(_)--o--o--

       __|__
         \ 
          \ 
           \ 
--o--o--(_)--o--o--
```

Picture it as if the plane is moving from left to right! For actual animations, you might want to look into programming libraries or applications that support animation. If there's anything else you need, feel free to ask!
Enter the prompt (or type 'quit' to exit): 1+1=? in quantum?
In classical arithmetic, \(1 + 1 = 2\). However, in the context of quantum mechanics, the question can take on a more abstract meaning, particularly in terms of quantum superposition and entangled states.

In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in superpositions of states. For example, if we think of \(1\) and \(1\) as representing quantum states (like the presence of one particle in two different states), they could exist simultaneously in a superimposed state rather than simply summing to \(2\).

So while classically, \(1 + 1 = 2\), quantum mechanically, the situation is more complex and depends on the nature of the systems you're discussing. If you provide more context or specify what you mean by "quantum," I can offer a more detailed answer!
